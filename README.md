# Lightning Strike Analysis: Temporal Trends and Visualization
This project involves the analysis of lightning strike data spanning from 2016 to 2018, obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
Utilizing Python programming language and relevant libraries, we calculate weekly sums of lightning strikes and visualize them through bar graphs.
Subsequently, quarterly lightning strike totals are computed and depicted on additional bar graphs. 
Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the temporal distribution and trends of lightning activity over the specified period. 
This repository serves as a resource for understanding lightning strike patterns and provides a foundation for further exploration and research in atmospheric phenomena.
